# Law Of Large Numbers  
The Law  of  Large  Numbers  states  that  as  the  size  of  a  sample  drawn  from  a  random  variable increases,
the  mean  of  more  samples gets  closer  and  closer  to  the  true  population  mean  Î¼.  

### Data:  
mean = 0  
stdev = 1 (standard deviation)  

### Steps:  
1. Generate random samples from a normal distribution:  
~~~~
set.seed(124)  
~~~~
The set.seed function is used to call a random number generator.  

2. Initialize sample size: 
~~~~
N <- 100  
~~~~
To create a variable, in this case N, the name of the variable is used followed by "<-" and the initial value.  
~~~~
sample <- rnorm(N)  
~~~~
To generate a sample of size N from a standard normal distribution the rnorm function is used. Only the argument n 
(sample size) has to be provided since the mean 0 and the standard deviation 1 are the default values for the mean and 
stdev arguments.  

3. Initialize counter:  
~~~~
counter <- 0  
~~~~

4. Loop for(i in rnorm(size)):  
~~~~
for(i in rnorm(100)){  
~~~~
"i" will take the values generated by the rnorm function until the sample size is completed (100).    
  
5. Check if the iterated variable falls between -1 and 1:  
~~~~
  if(i >= -1 && i <= 1){      
    print(i)  
~~~~
In each case the value of "i" will be evaluated to see if it falls between the values -1 and 1.  
If this condition is met, then the value will be printed.  

6. Increase counter if the condition is true:  
~~~~
    counter <- counter+1  
~~~~
Also (if the condition was met), the counter value will be increased by +1.  

7. Return a result <- counter / N:  
~~~~
    result <- counter / N  
  }  
}  
print(result)  
~~~~
Finally (if the condition was met), a 'result' value will also be returned, which will be equal to the result of the counter's division by the total number of the sample, and will be printed with the `print()` command.
