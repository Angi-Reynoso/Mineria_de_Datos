### ¿What is Data Mining?  
Data mining is the study of collecting, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and gaining useful insights from data. A wide 
variation exists in terms of the problem domains, applications, formulations, and data representations that are 
encountered in real applications. Therefore, “data mining” is a broad umbrella term that is used to describe these 
different aspects of data processing.  
In the modern age, virtually all automated systems generate some form of data either for diagnostic or analysis purposes. 
This has resulted in a deluge of data, which has been reaching the order of petabytes or exabytes. Some examples of 
different kinds of data are as follows:  
* World Wide Web  
* Financial interactions  
* User interactions  
* Sensor technologies and the Internet of Things  

The deluge of data is a direct result of advances in technology and the computerization of every aspect of modern life. 
It is, therefore, natural to examine whether one can extract concise and possibly actionable insights from the available 
data for application-specific goals.  
This is where the task of data mining comes in. The raw data may be arbitrary, unstructured, or even in a format that is 
not immediately suitable for automated processing. To address this issue, data mining analysts use a pipeline of 
processing, where the raw data are collected, cleaned, and transformed into a standardized format. The data may be stored 
in a commercial database system and finally processed for insights with the use of analytical methods. In fact, while 
data mining often conjures up the notion of analytical algorithms, the reality is that the vast majority of work is 
related to the data preparation portion of the process. This pipeline of processing is conceptually similar to that of 
an actual mining process from a mineral ore to the refined end product. The term “mining” derives its roots from this 
analogy.  

From an analytical perspective, data mining is challenging because of the wide disparity in the problems and data types 
that are encountered. Even within related classes of problems, the differences are quite significant. Nevertheless, in 
spite of these differences, data mining applications are often closely connected to one of four “super-problems” in 
data mining: association pattern mining, clustering, classification, and outlier detection. These problems are so 
important because they are used as building blocks in a majority of the applications in some indirect form or the other. 
This is a useful abstraction because it helps us conceptualize and structure the field of data mining more effectively.
