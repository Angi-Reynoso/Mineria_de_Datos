# QUIZ 1  
### What is Data Mining?  
Data mining is the study of collecting, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and gaining useful insights from data. A wide 
variation exists in terms of the problem domains, applications, formulations, and data representations that are 
encountered in real applications. Therefore, “data mining” is a broad umbrella term that is used to describe these 
different aspects of data processing.  
In the modern age, virtually all automated systems generate some form of data either for diagnostic or analysis purposes. 
This has resulted in a deluge of data, which has been reaching the order of petabytes or exabytes. Some examples of 
different kinds of data are as follows:  
* World Wide Web  
* Financial interactions  
* User interactions  
* Sensor technologies and the Internet of Things  

The deluge of data is a direct result of advances in technology and the computerization of every aspect of modern life. 
It is, therefore, natural to examine whether one can extract concise and possibly actionable insights from the available 
data for application-specific goals.  
This is where the task of data mining comes in. The raw data may be arbitrary, unstructured, or even in a format that is 
not immediately suitable for automated processing. To address this issue, data mining analysts use a pipeline of 
processing, where the raw data are collected, cleaned, and transformed into a standardized format. The data may be stored 
in a commercial database system and finally processed for insights with the use of analytical methods. In fact, while 
data mining often conjures up the notion of analytical algorithms, the reality is that the vast majority of work is 
related to the data preparation portion of the process. This pipeline of processing is conceptually similar to that of 
an actual mining process from a mineral ore to the refined end product. The term “mining” derives its roots from this 
analogy.  

From an analytical perspective, data mining is challenging because of the wide disparity in the problems and data types 
that are encountered. Even within related classes of problems, the differences are quite significant. Nevertheless, in 
spite of these differences, data mining applications are often closely connected to one of four “super-problems” in 
data mining: association pattern mining, clustering, classification, and outlier detection. These problems are so 
important because they are used as building blocks in a majority of the applications in some indirect form or the other. 
This is a useful abstraction because it helps us conceptualize and structure the field of data mining more effectively.

# HOMEWORK 2
### Types of Graphics

1. **Area chart**  
Area charts are similar to line charts, but with the area below the fill line with a specific color or texture. 
The area graphs locate data points in the layout of a grid of Cartesian coordinates, which is found by means of a line between them, and filling in the space at the bottom.

alt="Practice5" width="55%">

2. **Bar chart**  
The classic bar chart uses horizontal or vertical bars to show numerical comparisons of different categories. One of the axes of the graph shows the specific categories that are compared and the other axis represents a scale of values.
Bar graphs are distinguished from histograms in that they do not show continuous developments over an interval. The bar graph data is associated with the concepts that are valued and therefore expose quantitative information of each one of them.

alt="Practice5" width="65%">

3. **Box and whisker**  
Box and whisker diagrams are a great way to visually represent groups of numerical data.
Lines that extend in parallel at both ends of the boxes are known as "whiskers," and are used to indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles. Atypical values are sometimes represented as individual points that are in line with beards. Box diagrams can be constructed either vertically or horizontally.

alt="Practice5" width="55%">

4. **Density graphs**  
Also known as Kernel density graphs or tracking density graphs.
A density diagram visualizes the distribution of data over a period of interval or continuous time. This table is a variation of a histogram that uses a smoothed core to plot the values, which allows homogeneous curved distributions to smooth out the noise. The peaks are displayed on a density graphic help screen where the values are concentrated in the interval.

alt="Practice5" width="60%">

5. **Ring chart**  
A ring chart is essentially a pie chart with a cut center area.
A ring chart partially addresses the problem of emphasis, so that the viewer focuses more on changes in global values, paying attention to the reading of the length of the arches, rather than comparing the proportions between the slices.
Also the ring charts can take up less space, with the advantage over the sector charts of lending themselves to displaying information also in their blank interior space.

alt="Practice5" width="55%">

6. **Histogram**  
A histogram is very useful for the distribution of data over a continuous interval or a certain period of time. Each bar represents a histogram of the tabulated frequency in each interval. The longitudinal area of the histogram corresponds to the number of data.  
* The histograms help to have an estimate as to where the values are concentrated, the extremes that are found and if there are gaps or unusual values. They are also useful for offering an approximate view of the distribution of probabilities.

alt="Practice5" width="55%">

7. **Line chart**  
Line graphs are used to show quantitative values over a continuous period of time or interval. It is most often used to show trends and relationships, when several lines are grouped. Line charts also help to give a "global view" over an interval, to see how it has developed over that period.

alt="Practice5" width="55%">

* A clear example of this type of graph is the **frequency polygons**. Its operation is practically identical to that of histograms although using points instead of bars, with the exception that it allows establishing the slope between two of these points and the comparison between different variables related to the independent one or between the results of different experiments with same variables.

alt="Practice5" width="42%">

8. **Multiple bar chart**  
Also known as a grouped bar chart.  
This variation of a bar chart is used when two or more data sets are represented side by side grouping into categories, all on the same axis. Multiple bar charts are usually used to compare the variables of the grouped categories with those of other groups of those same variables or types of categories.  
* The disadvantage of multiple bar charts is that they become more difficult to read if there are many bars in many groups.

alt="Practice5" width="55%">

9. **Pictograms**  
A pictogram is a chart that uses pictures to represent data. Pictograms are set out in the same way as bar charts, but instead of bars they use columns of pictures to show the numbers involved.

alt="Practice5" width="55%">

10. **Pie charts**  
Are generally used to show percentage or proportional data and usually the percentage represented by each category is provided next to the corresponding slice of pie. Pie charts are good for displaying data for around 6 categories or fewer.

alt="Practice5" width="55%">

11. **Population pyramid**  
Population pyramid, also called an "age-gender-pyramid", is a graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age groups in a population (typically that of a country or region of the world), which forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing.

alt="Practice5" width="70%">

12. **Scatter plot**   
A scatter plot is a set of points plotted on a horizontal and vertical axes.
Scatter plots are important in statistics because they can show the extent of correlation, if any, between the values of observed quantities or phenomena (called variables). If no correlation exists between the variables, the points appear randomly scattered on the coordinate plane. If a large correlation exists, the points concentrate near a straight line. Scatter plots are useful data visualization tools for illustrating a trend.
