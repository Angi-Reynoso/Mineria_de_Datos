# Instructions:
You have been supplied data for two more additional in-game statistics:  
* Free Throws  
* Free Throws Attempts  

You need to create three plots that portray the following insights:  
* Free Throw Attempts per game  
* Accurancy of Free Throws  
* Player playing style (2 vs 3 points preference) excluding Free Throws  

- Each Free Throw is worth 1 point  

The data has been supplied in the form of vectors. You will have to create two matrices before you proceed with the analysis.

# Steps:  
### 1. Create a Matrix for Free Throws  
 1.1. Bind the given vectors to form the matrix:  
~~~~
FreeThrows <- rbind(KobeBryant_FT, JoeJohnson_FT, LeBronJames_FT, CarmeloAnthony_FT, DwightHoward_FT, ChrisBosh_FT, ChrisPaul_FT, KevinDurant_FT, DerrickRose_FT, DwayneWade_FT)
~~~~
> `rbind()`: description  

 1.2. Remove vectors - we don't need them anymore:  
~~~~
rm(KobeBryant_FT, JoeJohnson_FT, CarmeloAnthony_FT, DwightHoward_FT, ChrisBosh_FT, LeBronJames_FT, ChrisPaul_FT, DerrickRose_FT, DwayneWade_FT, KevinDurant_FT)
~~~~
> `rm()`: description  

1.3. Rename the columns:  
~~~~
colnames(FreeThrows) <- Seasons
~~~~
> `colnames()`: description  

1.4. Rename the rows:  
~~~~
rownames(FreeThrows) <- Players
~~~~
> `rownames()`: description  

1.5. Check the matrix:  
~~~~
FreeThrows
~~~~

### 2. Create a Matrix for Free Throw Attempts
